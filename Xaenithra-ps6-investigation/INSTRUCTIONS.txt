# HOW TO RUN TRINETRA (FULL SUITE)

To run the complete Integrated Forensic Suite (Indrajaal + Sudarshana + Kaal Chakra + Chitragupta):

1. Open your terminal (or tell the Agent to):

2. Execute this EXACT sequence:

   git clone https://github.com/utxdev/Xaenithra-ps6-investigation
   cd Xaenithra-ps6-investigation
   python run_trinetra.py

---------------------------------------------------------
WHAT THIS DOES:
- It downloads the code.
- It installs all Python dependencies (for Extraction & Threat Engine).
- It installs all Frontend dependencies.
- It LAUNCHES all 3 servers automatically.
- It OPENS the Unified Dashboard (Trinetra Hub) in your browser.

DO NOT run 'npm run dev' manually unless you know what you are doing.
ALWAYS use `python run_trinetra.py`.
